## Hello, Keith here. ðŸ‘‹
I'm happy to be here on GitHub. 

I am an adjunct professor of Business Technology at Bellevue College in Bellevue, Washington, just outside of Seattle. Bellevue College is the third-largest institution of higher learning in the state of Washington (after the University of Washington and Washington State). We are an open-access 4-year college with community college roots that now offers several Bachelor's degrees. 

Several years ago, I began teaching BATECH 189 Web Authoring Essentials, which has become one of my favorite classes to teach, mainly because of the design power of HTML and CSS. I have a Master's degree in Interdisciplinary Arts from Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, and am a visual artist and musician. So, it obviously makes sense that I teach Business Technology, right? ;-)

I have been teaching here at Bellevue College since the Fall of 2007, and in 2015 won the Margin of Excellence Award for best adjunct professor at the college. Subsequently that year, I delivered the faculty address at our Spring graduation at Climate Pledge Arena in downtown Seattle. 

Please contact me with any questions!

Blessings, 
Keith
